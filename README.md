It is highly recommended to always use SSL certificate verification. 
By default, urllib3 does not verify HTTPS requests.
In order to enable verification you will need a set of root certificates. 
The easiest and most reliable method is to use the certifi package which provides Mozillaâ€™s root certificate bundle:

pip install certifi
